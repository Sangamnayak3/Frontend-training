1. a. What is MVC and MVVM?
   b. What is Single Responsibility Principle?
__ The Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is an architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components Model, View, and Controller. Each architectural component is built to handle specific development aspects of an application. It isolates the business logic and presentation layer from each other.
__ Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is an architectural pattern in computer software that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (GUI; the view)—be it via a markup language or GUI code—from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) such that the view is not dependent upon any specific model platform.

__ The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer programming principle that states that "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor." The term actor refers to a group (consisting of one or more stakeholders or users) that requires a change in the module.

2.  What are keys in React JS? How involve keys in array processing in React?
__ A key is a unique identifier. In React, it is used to identify which items have changed, updated, or deleted from the Lists. It is useful when we dynamically created components or when the users alter the lists. It also helps to determine which components in a collection needs to be re-rendered instead of re-rendering the entire set of components every time.
__ Keys in react are used to identify a list of DOM elements from the same hierarchy internally.
So if we are iterating over an array to show a list of li elements, each of the li elements needs a unique identifier specified by the key property. This usually can be the id of our database item or the index of the array.
