1. Why do you use position property in CSS?

2. What is the difference between position property values :  absolute / relative;

1__The CSS position property is used to set position for an element. It is also used to place an element behind another and also useful for scripted animation effect.
We can position an element using the top, bottom, left and right properties. These properties can be used only after position property is set first. A position element's computed position property is relative, absolute, fixed or sticky.

2__Relative Position: Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: relative; property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. The other objects or elements will not fill the gap. Absolute Position: An element with position: absolute; will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent.
